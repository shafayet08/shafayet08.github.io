 In this project I analysed some of the data I got from Kaggle regarding the pattern of the 911 calls received by the emergency department in the USA.


 The project was done in Jupyter Notebook using python and its' visualization libraries.


 ```python
       import numpy as np
       import pandas as pd
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       import seaborn as sns
       %matplotlib inline

  ```
