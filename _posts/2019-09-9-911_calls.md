 In this project I analysed some of the data I got from Kaggle regarding the pattern of the 911 calls received by the emergency department in the USA.


 The project was done in Jupyter Notebook using python and its' visualization libraries.


 ```python
       import numpy as np
       import pandas as pd
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       import seaborn as sns
       %matplotlib inline

  ```
 ```python
  #reading and checking the information of  the  csv file from the folder.
   df = pd.read_csv('911.csv')
   df.info()
 ```
 This gives us the output:

 It can be seen that the table has 99492 rows and 9 columns of information which is a good amount of data to derive some conclusions.

 Then I wanted to know the content and the type of the data I am dealing with.
 ```python
   df.head()
```
 <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/911/911datahead.jpg" alt="data table">

The top 5 townships where the calls came from.
```python
   df['twp'].value_counts().head(5)
```

 Next I wanted to know what the biggest reason for the 911 calls was. In order to get that I had to make a new column. I used lambda expression to create a new column.
 ```python
     df['Reason']=df['title'].apply(lambda title : title.split(':')[0])
     df['Reason'].value_counts()
```
 <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/911/Reason.jpg" alt="reasons">

 EMS is the highest reason for the 911 calls.

I wanted to display the result in chart and hence for that I used the seaborn library.

```python
     sns.countplot(x='Reason',data=df,palette='PuBuGn_d')
```
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/911/reasonseaborn.jpg" alt="reasons barplot">

Now I want to play with the time and date of the data set so for that I had to first
convert the timestamp column from string to date time object
```python
df['timeStamp']=pd.to_datetime(df['timeStamp'])
type(df['timeStamp'].iloc[0])
```

This will let me  modify the data set by adding new columns to it. Hence I created 3 new columns  for day ,month and time of the day using the lambda function.

```python
time = df['timeStamp'].iloc[0]
df['Hour']=df['timeStamp'].apply(lambda time: time.hour)
df['Month']=df['timeStamp'].apply(lambda time:time.month)
df['Day of Week']=df['timeStamp'].apply(lambda time:time.dayofweek)
```
