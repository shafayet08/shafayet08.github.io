The data used in here was collected from Kaggle. As I am huge Liverpool FC fan, I analyzed their performance at the top flight of English football from 1992-1993 season to 2017-2018 season.

```Python
     import pandas as pd
     import numpy as np
     import seaborn as sns
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     %matplotlib inline
     df = pd.read_csv('premierLeague_1992-2017.csv')
     df.head()
```
